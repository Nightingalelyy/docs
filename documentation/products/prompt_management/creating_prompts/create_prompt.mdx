## Quick start

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new prompt">
Once you have signed up and created an account, you can create a new prompt on the platform. Go to the [Prompts page](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/prompts) and click on the "Create new prompt" button. You should name your prompt and could add a description to it.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure the prompt">
Once you have created a new prompt, you can configure it. Go to the `Editor` tab and you can begin to write your prompt. The right side of the screen defines your prompt. You can set parameters like `Model`, `Temperature`, `Max Tokens`, and `Top P`. You can also add function calls and fallback models to your prompt. Check out the details [here](/api-endpoints/observe/logs/request-logging-endpoint).

    </Step>
<Step title="Write the content">
Once you have configured your prompt, you can write the content of your prompt. Click on the `+ Add message` button to add a new message to your prompt. You can change the role of the message to `user` or `assistant` by clicking on the role name.

    </Step>
<Step title="Variables in the prompt">
You can also add variables to your prompt. Variables are placeholders for dynamic content that can be used to generate prompts. Simply add double curly braces `{{variable_name}}` to your prompt and you will be able to use the variable in your prompt.

Replace the User message with this:
```
Please develop an optimized Python function to {{task_description}}, 
utilizing {{specific_library}},include error handling, and write unit tests for the function.
```
<Note>
The format of the variable can't be `{{task description}}`. It should be `{{task_description}}` with "_" instead of spaces.

</Step>
<Step title="Commit the first version">
After did this, you can:
1. Add a value for each variable in the `Variables` tab.
2. Click `Run` to test your prompt.

You now just finished writing your first version of the prompt.

You can click on the `Commit` button and write a commit message, which is helpful for you to track the changes you made to your prompt.
