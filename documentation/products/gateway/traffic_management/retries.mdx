There are 2 ways to enable Retries and set the number of retries and the time to wait before retrying:
## Add it from the UI
Go to the [Retries page](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/api/retries) and enable retries and set the number of retries and the initial retry time.
<Frame>
<img height="200" width="500"  src="/images/api-features/retries.png" alt="Retries Page"/>
</Frame>


## Add it in code
You can also add the retry parameters in the request body to enable retries and set the number of retries and the time to wait before retrying.
```json 
{
// ...some other Respan params...
    "retry_params": {
        "num_retries": 3,
        "retry_after": 0.1,  // seconds, minimum time to wait before retry.
        "retry_enabled": true
    }
}
```
