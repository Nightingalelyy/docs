## What is evaluations?
Evaluations help you assess the performance of your prompts. You can create custom evals to measure different dimensions of output quality.

## Why use evaluations?
- To measure the quality of a prompt or a model.
- To find the best prompt or model for a specific task.
- To optimize your prompts and models.
