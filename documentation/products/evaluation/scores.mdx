Log Scores Management allows you to assign, track, and analyze evaluation scores for your LLM requests. This feature enables you to:

- Manually score individual log responses
- Integrate custom evaluators with your workflow
- Track quality metrics over time
- Compare performance across different models or prompts

## Understanding Scores

Scores represent evaluation results for specific logs. Each score is associated with:

- A specific log (identified by `log_id`)
- An evaluator (either a Respan evaluator or your custom evaluator)
- One or more value types (numerical, string, boolean)

<Note>
Each log can have multiple scores, but only one score per evaluator. This ensures clean, consistent evaluation data.
</Note>

## Score Types

You can use three types of values for your scores:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Numerical" icon="calculator">
    A floating-point value (e.g., 4.5 out of 5.0)
  </Card>
  <Card title="String" icon="font">
    A text description or category (e.g., "Good quality")
  </Card>
  <Card title="Boolean" icon="toggle-on">
    A pass/fail indicator (true/false)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can use any combination of these types in a single score.

## Using the Scores API

The Scores API allows you to programmatically manage scores. See the [API Reference](/api-endpoints/evaluate/scores) for detailed documentation.

Here's a quick example of creating a score:

```python
import requests

api_key = "your_api_key"
log_id = "your_log_id"

url = f"https://api.respan.ai/api/logs/{log_id}/scores/"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "evaluator_slug": "response_quality",
    "numerical_value": 4.2,
    "string_value": "Good response with minor issues",
    "boolean_value": True
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Viewing Scores in the Dashboard

Scores are visible in the log details view in the Respan dashboard. You can:

1. Navigate to the Logs section
2. Click on a specific log to view its details
3. See all scores associated with that log in the Scores tab

## Best Practices

- **Use consistent evaluator slugs** across your application
- **Define clear scoring criteria** for each evaluator
- **Combine with automated evaluations** for comprehensive quality assessment
- **Track scores over time** to measure improvements

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Experiments](/documentation/products/evaluation/experiments/overview) for systematic evaluation
- Explore [LLM Evaluators](/documentation/products/evaluation/llm-evals/llm-evaluator) for automated scoring
- Set up [Human Evaluations](/documentation/products/evaluation/human-evals/human-evals-setup) for subjective assessment
