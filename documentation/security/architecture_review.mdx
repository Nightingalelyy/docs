Respan provides LLM observability service: keeping track of all the inputs to and outputs of LLM inferences, along with any additional metrics that are calculated during the inference, such as token usage, generation time etc.

## Architecture and Data Flow Overview

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as the primary cloud service provider
- **Application hosted on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
- **Redis** for event queue management
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage
- **ClickHouse** for high-performance analytics and observability data warehousing

### Data Flow

1. Client requests are sent to our API server hosted on AWS ECS
2. During LLM inference operations, events are generated and pushed to Redis queue
3. Celery workers consume these events from Redis
4. Data is batch inserted into PostgreSQL and ClickHouse

## Security and Encryption Standards

- **All API communications secured via TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)**
- **Authentication credentials and API keys** are hashed using SHA-256 (SHA-2 family) before storage
- **Data at rest is encrypted** using AWS-managed encryption (AES-256)
- **Inter-service communication** within AWS infrastructure is secured through AWS security groups

## Security Operations

- **Regular internal security audits** (monthly)
- **Weekly security testing** of applications
- **Continuous monitoring** via AWS CloudWatch
- **Regular code reviews** (weekly)
- **Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing** planned for next security roadmap phase

## Access Controls

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** required
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with least privilege
- **Just-in-time (JIT)** access for administrative functions
- **Regular access reviews** and deprovisioning

## Incident Response

- **Dedicated incident response team** with defined roles
- **Customer notification** within 24 hours of any security incident
- **Detailed incident reports** and remediation plans
- **Post-incident reviews** and continuous improvement

## Business Continuity

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour
- **Automated daily backups** with cross-region replication
- **Regular disaster recovery testing**

## Compliance & Certifications

- **SOC 2 Type II** - Security, Availability, Confidentiality (Certified)
- **HIPAA** - Healthcare data protection compliance
- **GDPR** - European data protection compliance
- **AWS and GCP security frameworks** utilized

## Security Reports

Detailed security architecture documentation, penetration test reports, and compliance certificates are available to enterprise customers under NDA.
