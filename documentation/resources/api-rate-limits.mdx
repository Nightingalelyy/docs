## Basics rate limits

We apply per-endpoint rate limits to protect the platform and ensure fair usage across all organizations.

| Endpoint Category | Rate Limit | Scope |
|------------------|------------|-------|
| Users API | 60 requests/minute | Per organization |
| Other APIs (excluding Logs & Gateway) | 60 requests/minute | Per organization |

## When Limits Are Exceeded

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive an **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** response:

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

The `retry_after` field indicates the number of seconds you should wait before retrying.
