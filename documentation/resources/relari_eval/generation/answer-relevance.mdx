title: "Answer relevance"
---

LLM-based Answer Relevance outputs a score between 0.0 - 1.0 assessing the consistency of the generated answer based on the reference ground truth answers.

### Scoring rubric in LLM prompt:
* 0.0 means that the answer is completely irrelevant to the question.
* 0.5 means that the answer is partially relevant to the question or it only partially answers the question.
* 1.0 means that the answer is relevant to the question and completely answers the question.
