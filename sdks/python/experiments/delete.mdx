title: "Delete Experiment"
description: "Remove an experiment from your account"
---

## Overview

The `delete` method allows you to permanently remove an experiment from your account. This action is irreversible and will delete all associated data including results and configurations.

## Method Signature

### Synchronous
```python
def delete(experiment_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Asynchronous
```python
async def delete(experiment_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `experiment_id` | `str` | Yes | The unique identifier of the experiment to delete |

## Returns

Returns a dictionary confirming the deletion with details about the deleted experiment.

## Examples

### Basic Deletion
```python
from respan import Respan

client = Respan(api_key="your-api-key")

# Delete an experiment
result = client.experiments.delete("exp_123")

print(f"Deleted experiment: {result['experiment_id']}")
print(f"Deletion confirmed at: {result['deleted_at']}")
```

### Safe Deletion with Confirmation
```python
# Get experiment details before deletion
experiment = client.experiments.get("exp_123")

print(f"About to delete experiment: {experiment['name']}")
print(f"Status: {experiment['status']}")
print(f"Created: {experiment['created_at']}")

# Confirm deletion
confirm = input("Are you sure you want to delete this experiment? (yes/no): ")

if confirm.lower() == 'yes':
    result = client.experiments.delete("exp_123")
    print(f"Experiment {result['experiment_id']} has been deleted")
else:
    print("Deletion cancelled")
```

### Check Status Before Deletion
```python
# Only delete if experiment is in appropriate status
experiment = client.experiments.get("exp_123")

if experiment['status'] in ['draft', 'completed']:
    result = client.experiments.delete("exp_123")
    print(f"Deleted {experiment['status']} experiment: {experiment['name']}")
elif experiment['status'] == 'running':
    print("Cannot delete running experiment. Stop it first.")
    # Optionally stop the experiment first
    # client.experiments.stop("exp_123")
    # result = client.experiments.delete("exp_123")
else:
    print(f"Experiment status '{experiment['status']}' - check if deletion is appropriate")
```

### Asynchronous Deletion
```python
import asyncio
from respan import AsyncRespan

async def delete_experiment_example():
    client = AsyncRespan(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    try:
        result = await client.experiments.delete("exp_123")
        print(f"Async deletion completed: {result['experiment_id']}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Deletion failed: {e}")
        return None

asyncio.run(delete_experiment_example())
```

### Batch Deletion
```python
# Delete multiple experiments
experiment_ids = ["exp_123", "exp_456", "exp_789"]
deleted_experiments = []
failed_deletions = []

for exp_id in experiment_ids:
    try:
        result = client.experiments.delete(exp_id)
        deleted_experiments.append(result)
        print(f"✅ Deleted: {exp_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        failed_deletions.append({"id": exp_id, "error": str(e)})
        print(f"❌ Failed to delete {exp_id}: {e}")

print(f"\nSummary:")
print(f"Successfully deleted: {len(deleted_experiments)}")
print(f"Failed deletions: {len(failed_deletions)}")

if failed_deletions:
    print("\nFailed deletions:")
    for failure in failed_deletions:
        print(f"- {failure['id']}: {failure['error']}")
```

### Conditional Deletion
```python
# Delete experiments based on criteria
experiments_response = client.experiments.list(status="draft", limit=100)
draft_experiments = experiments_response['experiments']

# Delete old draft experiments (older than 30 days)
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)
old_drafts = []

for experiment in draft_experiments:
    created_at = datetime.fromisoformat(experiment['created_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
    if created_at < cutoff_date:
        old_drafts.append(experiment)

print(f"Found {len(old_drafts)} old draft experiments to delete")

for experiment in old_drafts:
    try:
        result = client.experiments.delete(experiment['id'])
        print(f"Deleted old draft: {experiment['name']}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to delete {experiment['name']}: {e}")
```

### Backup Before Deletion
```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Backup experiment data before deletion
def backup_and_delete_experiment(experiment_id):
    # Get experiment data
    experiment = client.experiments.get(experiment_id)
    
    # Create backup file
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    backup_filename = f"experiment_backup_{experiment_id}_{timestamp}.json"
    
    # Save backup
    with open(backup_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(experiment, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
    
    print(f"Backup saved to: {backup_filename}")
    
    # Delete experiment
    result = client.experiments.delete(experiment_id)
    print(f"Experiment deleted: {result['experiment_id']}")
    
    return backup_filename, result

# Usage
backup_file, deletion_result = backup_and_delete_experiment("exp_123")
print(f"Backup: {backup_file}")
print(f"Deleted: {deletion_result['experiment_id']}")
```

### Asynchronous Batch Deletion
```python
import asyncio
from respan import AsyncRespan

async def batch_delete_experiments(experiment_ids):
    client = AsyncRespan(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    async def delete_single_experiment(exp_id):
        try:
            result = await client.experiments.delete(exp_id)
            print(f"✅ Deleted: {exp_id}")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Failed to delete {exp_id}: {e}")
            return None
    
    # Delete all experiments concurrently
    tasks = [delete_single_experiment(exp_id) for exp_id in experiment_ids]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Filter successful deletions
    successful_deletions = [result for result in results if result is not None]
    
    print(f"\nDeleted {len(successful_deletions)} out of {len(experiment_ids)} experiments")
    return successful_deletions

# Usage
experiment_ids = ["exp_123", "exp_456", "exp_789"]
deleted = asyncio.run(batch_delete_experiments(experiment_ids))
```

### Delete with Metadata Check
```python
# Delete experiments with specific metadata
experiments_response = client.experiments.list(limit=100)
experiments = experiments_response['experiments']

# Find experiments marked for deletion
to_delete = []
for experiment in experiments:
    metadata = experiment.get('metadata', {})
    if metadata.get('marked_for_deletion') or metadata.get('temporary'):
        to_delete.append(experiment)

print(f"Found {len(to_delete)} experiments marked for deletion")

for experiment in to_delete:
    try:
        # Double-check metadata before deletion
        current_exp = client.experiments.get(experiment['id'])
        current_metadata = current_exp.get('metadata', {})
        
        if current_metadata.get('marked_for_deletion'):
            result = client.experiments.delete(experiment['id'])
            print(f"Deleted marked experiment: {experiment['name']}")
        else:
            print(f"Skipped {experiment['name']} - no longer marked for deletion")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to delete {experiment['name']}: {e}")
```

### Deletion with Audit Log
```python
import csv
from datetime import datetime

# Create audit log for deletions
def delete_with_audit(experiment_id, reason=""):
    # Get experiment info before deletion
    experiment = client.experiments.get(experiment_id)
    
    # Delete experiment
    result = client.experiments.delete(experiment_id)
    
    # Log deletion
    audit_entry = {
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'experiment_id': experiment_id,
        'experiment_name': experiment['name'],
        'status_at_deletion': experiment['status'],
        'created_at': experiment['created_at'],
        'deleted_by': 'current_user',  # Replace with actual user info
        'reason': reason,
        'variants_count': len(experiment.get('variants', [])),
        'had_results': 'current_results' in experiment
    }
    
    # Append to audit log file
    audit_file = 'experiment_deletions_audit.csv'
    file_exists = False
    try:
        with open(audit_file, 'r'):
            file_exists = True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    
    with open(audit_file, 'a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        fieldnames = audit_entry.keys()
        writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        
        if not file_exists:
            writer.writeheader()
        
        writer.writerow(audit_entry)
    
    print(f"Deleted experiment {experiment_id} and logged to {audit_file}")
    return result

# Usage
result = delete_with_audit("exp_123", "Experiment completed and no longer needed")
```

### Safe Deletion Function
```python
def safe_delete_experiment(experiment_id, force=False):
    """
    Safely delete an experiment with checks and confirmations
    """
    try:
        # Get experiment details
        experiment = client.experiments.get(experiment_id)
        
        # Check if experiment can be safely deleted
        if experiment['status'] == 'running' and not force:
            return {
                'success': False,
                'error': 'Cannot delete running experiment without force=True'
            }
        
        # Check if experiment has important results
        if 'current_results' in experiment and not force:
            total_requests = experiment['current_results'].get('total_requests', 0)
            if total_requests > 1000:
                return {
                    'success': False,
                    'error': f'Experiment has {total_requests} requests. Use force=True to delete.'
                }
        
        # Perform deletion
        result = client.experiments.delete(experiment_id)
        
        return {
            'success': True,
            'result': result,
            'experiment_name': experiment['name']
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        }

# Usage
deletion_result = safe_delete_experiment("exp_123")

if deletion_result['success']:
    print(f"Successfully deleted: {deletion_result['experiment_name']}")
else:
    print(f"Deletion failed: {deletion_result['error']}")
```

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = client.experiments.delete("exp_123")
    print(f"Experiment deleted successfully: {result['experiment_id']}")
except Exception as e:
    error_msg = str(e).lower()
    
    if "not found" in error_msg:
        print("Experiment not found - may have already been deleted")
    elif "permission" in error_msg:
        print("Permission denied - you don't have permission to delete this experiment")
    elif "running" in error_msg:
        print("Cannot delete running experiment - stop it first")
    elif "has active" in error_msg:
        print("Experiment has active dependencies - resolve them first")
    else:
        print(f"Deletion failed: {e}")
```

## Safety Considerations

- **Irreversible Action**: Deletion permanently removes all experiment data
- **Running Experiments**: Some systems may prevent deletion of running experiments
- **Data Loss**: All results, configurations, and metadata will be lost
- **Dependencies**: Check for any dependent systems or reports before deletion
- **Backup**: Consider backing up important experiment data before deletion

## Best Practices

- Always confirm deletion for important experiments
- Check experiment status before deletion
- Backup experiment data if results are valuable
- Use batch deletion carefully with proper error handling
- Maintain audit logs for compliance and tracking
- Consider "soft deletion" (marking as deleted) for critical experiments

## Alternative Approaches

### Soft Deletion
```python
# Instead of deleting, mark as deleted
experiment = client.experiments.update(
    experiment_id="exp_123",
    metadata={
        "deleted": True,
        "deleted_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "deleted_by": "user_123"
    }
)
print("Experiment marked as deleted (soft deletion)")
```

### Archiving
```python
# Archive instead of delete
experiment = client.experiments.update(
    experiment_id="exp_123",
    metadata={
        "archived": True,
        "archived_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "archive_reason": "Experiment completed, results preserved"
    }
)
print("Experiment archived")
```

## Common Use Cases

- Cleaning up old draft experiments
- Removing failed or invalid experiments
- Batch deletion of temporary experiments
- Removing experiments after data export
- Cleanup during account migration
- Removing experiments with sensitive data
